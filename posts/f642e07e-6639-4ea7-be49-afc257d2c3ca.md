Cats have been making a big difference in the tech world for years, inspiring popular culture and being the source of many pet-owner jokes. But few people know that cats have been instrumental in the development of computer programming since its earliest days. Let’s take a look at some of the ways cats have been influencing the world of coding and what the future might hold for feline-friendly programming.

## Cats and the History of Coding

Cats have been associated with coding throughout its history — even if they weren't actively involved in the process. In the 1970s, when coding was still a fringe activity, the image of a black cat peeking out of a computer monitor became a symbol of the mysterious, arcane world of computer programming. This symbolic 'cat' is known as a 'Nyan Cat', and has been featured on websites and computer software ever since.

More recently, cats have actually begun to play a direct role in coding. In 2013, a San Francisco-based startup made headlines when it unveiled its innovative cat-programmed code. Called 'Cat Code', the new software was designed to use cats' natural tendencies to explore and problem-solve to make coding easier and more efficient.
