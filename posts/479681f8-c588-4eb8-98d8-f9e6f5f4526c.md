The Icelandic Horse is more than just a beautiful animal, it is a beloved national symbol in Iceland, with a rich history of use throughout the country’s history. Its unique, sturdy breed makes it perfect for all kinds of activities, from leisure riding to competitive fields like racing and dressage. It's also known for its intelligence and loyalty, making it a great companion for both children and adults.

The Icelandic Horse is a native breed of horse, meaning it is only found in Iceland and can trace its lineage back to horses brought to the island by settlers in the ninth century. In a country with a long, harsh winter and limited supplies, these horses were a vital means of transportation and sustenance. They served as draft animals, used in farming and helped with the transport of goods and people.

Due to its unique genetics, the Icelandic Horse differs from other breeds in a few ways. For one, it is exceptionally long-lived and robust, able to live well into its 20s with proper care and nutrition. It is also known for its four distinct gaits – the walk, the trot, the canter, and the unique flying pace – making it a great choice for those looking for a more comfortable ride.
